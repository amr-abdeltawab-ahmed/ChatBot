# ChatBot
Hello, I used Python to create:

1- ChatBot (Command Line Version)
The ChatBot Command Line Version is a text-based interaction with a computer program. Users communicate with the ChatBot by entering messages in the command line or terminal. The ChatBot responds with predefined text-based responses. This version is suitable for users who prefer a simple and command-line-based chatbot experience and is often used for scripting and automation tasks.


2- ChatBot (GUI Version)
The ChatBot GUI Version is a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to engage in conversations with a computer program. This interactive application features a colorful and visually appealing user interface. Users can type their messages in an input field, click the "Send" button, and receive predefined responses from the ChatBot. The GUI Version is designed for a user-friendly and enjoyable chatbot experience.
